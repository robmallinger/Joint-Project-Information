# Joint Project Information
Set up 27 November 2018 by Rob to provide an initial organization scheme

We.....
  Dan Albrecht-Mallinger
  Renee Albrecht-Mallinger
  Rob Albrecht-Mallinger
...intend to collaborate on a few projects for which we will use GitHub to manage
the various sources, and also to hone our GitHub chops in the process.

This repo (Joint-Project-Information) is where we will keep things organized,
by laying out the taxonomy of projects/repositories and their various attributes,
share some rules of the road, and park information that seems of general interest.

Project | Repo Name | Whazit? | Whose?
--- | --- | --- | --- |
the hub | Joint-Project-Information | this repo! |joint
Mom's website | BetterBirths.com  | Mom's website code, assets, etc. | joint
Agile Afield! | tbd | iBook/Kindle sources for a text applying agile practices to field work | joint

## Rules of the road
- Default access is read&write for all three of us. We are all three welcome to use the account for experimentation, adding repos for our individual work as well as share work, without prior notice or coordination. However, we need to caucus before adding any users besides the three of use.  And eventually, you probably want to remove unused personal experiments, if only because someone else may accidentally mess it up.
- Which leads me to: Don't delete anything which is not your own. Don't delete any joint projects unless we all concur.
- Use README.md for each repo we share, and use the heck out of it to turn on the lights and lay tape down.  Early on, caucus the participants and figure out the directory structure.  List the authors. Keep it up to date with new rules/agreements.  Look at it from time to time.

## Some stuff we need to work out
- What is the integration model we will use? Will it vary across projects? The GitHub workflow assumption is Integration-Manager but let's not assume that. Perhaps that should be recorded in the README.md for each repo.
